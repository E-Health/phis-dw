# :hospital: Public Health Data Warehouse Framework on FHIR

## Deprecated. Moved to: [https://github.com/E-Health/fhir-server-phis-dw](https://github.com/E-Health/fhir-server-phis-dw) 

## About

Public health databases are vital for the community for efficient planning, surveillance and effective interventions. PHIS-DW adopts FHIR as the data model for storage with Lucene for search. Kibana provides the visualization engine. [:eyes: Drishti](https://github.com/E-Health/drishti) is our framework for FHIR based behavioural intervention repository. PHIS-DW is based on :eyes: Drishti, and can support complex algorithms for disease surveillance such as machine learning methods, hidden Markov models, and Bayesian to multivariate analytics. PHIS-DW is work in progress and code contributions are welcome. We intend to use [Bunsen](https://github.com/cerner/bunsen) to integrate PHIS-DW with [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) for big data applications.
